## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I find it very difficult to find the perfect grid system in terms of the number of columns and rows, if you find improvements it is a pleasure to read them.

### Continued development

I would like to continue applying this knowledge to complete future challenges and even future projects.
